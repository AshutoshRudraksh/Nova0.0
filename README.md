# nova0.0

**nova0.0** is a simple voice AI chatbot prototype built with Python. This project is a learning experiment to explore real-time conversational AI by integrating multiple cutting-edge technologies:

- **AssemblyAI**: For accurate real-time speech-to-text transcription.
- **OpenAI**: Utilizing powerful language models for natural language processing and response generation.
- **ElevenLabs**: Implementing AI voice synthesis to convert text responses into natural-sounding audio.

## **Project Overview**

This application captures audio input from the user, transcribes it in real-time, processes the text using OpenAI's language model to generate appropriate responses, and then uses ElevenLabs' API to synthesize the response back into speech.

## **Objectives**

- Gain hands-on experience with AI and machine learning APIs.
- Understand the integration of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies.
- Build a foundational prototype for a more advanced voice AI assistant in the future.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the application.
- **AssemblyAI API**: For speech-to-text transcription.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating conversational responses.
- **ElevenLabs API**: For text-to-speech synthesis.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
- API keys for AssemblyAI, OpenAI, and ElevenLabs.
- Necessary Python packages installed (details will be provided in the installation section).

### **Installation**
